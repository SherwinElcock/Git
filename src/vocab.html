    <h2>Some common git terms you'll hear.</h2>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-12">
      <h3 class="term"> Branch</h3>
      <p class="definition">A break-off of your project. It's in your repository, but changes there don't affect your master branch. Say you want to test something,
        you create a branch, make and test your changes. Once you are sure everything is OK, merge into master.
        If you mess something up, you're on a branch, the master is fine.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Clone</h3>
      <p class="definition">A copy of a repository that is on your local machine not on a server elsewhere.
        This is where you mess around.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Commit</h3>
      <p class="definition">A change/revision to a file/group of files. You want to add a message as to what was changed.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Diff</h3>
      <p class="definition">Difference between two commits. Normally shows what is added/removed since the last commit.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Fork</h3>
      <p class="definition">A copy of someone else's repository that will be in your account. Let's you mess with it and not
        mess with theirs. Think you have something worthwhile, you can submit a pull request and see if the author will
        update it with your changes. Also let's you stay recent by pulling original again.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Merge</h3>
      <p class="definition">When the changes from one branch are applied to another. Usually a pull request.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Pull</h3>
      <p class="definition">When you pull in changes and merge them.
        Changes have been made, you'll want to pull those in.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Pull request</h3>
      <p class="definition">These are the proposed changes to a repo. Can either be accepted or rejected.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Push</h3>
      <p class="definition">Pushing the changes you've committed to a remote repository... GitHub.
        You make a change on your clone, you'll have to push those changes so others can access them.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Remote</h3>
      <p class="definition">Version that is on the remote server, GitHub. This is what gets cloned and your changes
        are merged here.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Repository</h3>
      <p class="definition">The folder of everything. It holds all of your files and each revision of the files.</p>
      <h3 class="term">Upstream</h3>
      <p class="definition">This working version, the main copy on the original repository.
        It's upstream as that is where all other changes come from. You are working on a downstream form or branch.</p>
